# Video Calls Guild

## What You're Building

Your guild is building the video calling system. Family members schedule video calls through the web portal by requesting a time slot. An administrator approves the request (or it's auto-approved based on rules). The incarcerated person gets a notification and sees the scheduled call. At the scheduled time, both parties join a WebRTC video call with camera, microphone, and background blur controls. A timer counts down and the call auto-disconnects at the limit.

> **Important context:** We use "video calls," not "video visits." "Video visit" is industry language created to justify eliminating in-person visits.

## Platforms

| Interface | App | Platform | Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Incarcerated Person | Android tablet app | Vite/React targeting JP6 (1280x800) | `apps/tablet` |
| Family/Loved One | PWA | Vite/React, browser-based | `apps/web` |
| Facility Administrator | Dashboard | Browser-based | `guilds/admin` |

Video calling guild logic lives in `guilds/video`.

## How Your Work Connects to Other Guilds

- You share the `approved_contacts` table with the Voice and Messaging guilds.
- Your `video_calls` table feeds into the Admin Platform's unified dashboard.
- You depend on the Admin Platform's `video_call_time_slots` configuration for available scheduling windows.
- You use the same authentication and user profile system as everyone else.
